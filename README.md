Sprint 1: Connect 4

Project description: Connect 4 provides a language connecting service. A user can enter a language they would like to learn, select a tutor, and meet either in person or online to begin their lesson. 

Connect 4 is an innovative language learning and cultural exchange platform designed to connect individuals who want to learn a new language with experienced tutors or native speakers in their community. The platform enables users to find tutors based on their language preferences, learning goals, and preferred mode of interaction whether through online video sessions or in person meetings.

With Connect 4, we aim to break language barriers, foster inclusivity, and create a supportive environment where users can learn, teach, and engage with different cultures. Our goal is to promote mutual aid and knowledge sharing, making language learning more accessible and community driven rather than solely a commercial service.
